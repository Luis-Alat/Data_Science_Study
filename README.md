# Study Notebooks
Notebooks developed while self-studying topics of interest to me. It is not intended to be a guide of any kind.

## Getting started

A conda environment is available to run the notebooks locally (see below) if you want. In this regard, I highly recommend mamba to handle the importing of the enviroment because of Conda may face problems about lack of memory. Anyway, the sintax is basically the same between both of them

### Importing using conda

Run the follosing command using conda to create the environment

	conda env create --file environment.yml
		
### Importing using mamba

Run the following command using mamba to create the environment

	mamba env create --file environment.yml

## Notes

* For a better display of the notebooks (for some plotly plots), I recommed the use of **nbviewer** at https://nbviewer.org/
