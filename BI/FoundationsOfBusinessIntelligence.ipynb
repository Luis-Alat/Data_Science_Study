This is because BI involves establishing repeatable methods to understand how things are operating and by knowing the current state, company leaders can take action to improve the future state (Because BI is all about near-real-time rapid monitoring, BI insights are most effective when they make an impact right now)"

    "\n",
    "#### Modular design\n",
    "\n",
    "A pipeline takes multiple processes and combines them into a system that automatically handles the data. Modular design principles can enable the development of individual pieces of a pipeline system so they can be treated as unique building blocks. Modular design also makes it possible to optimize and change individual components of a system without disrupting the rest of the pipeline. In addition, it helps users isolate and troubleshoot errors quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other best practices related to modular design include using version control. Also, BI professionals can create a separate development environment to test and review changes before implementing them.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Creating a testing environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Building the pipeline processes is only one aspect of creating data pipelines; it’s an iterative process that might require you to make updates and changes depending on how technology or business needs change. Because you will want to continue making improvements to the system, you need to create ways to test any changes before they’re implemented to avoid disrupting users’ access to the data. This could include creating a separate staging environment for data where you can run tests or including a stable dataset that you can make changes to and compare to current processes without interrupting the current flow.\n",

    "There are a few questions you can keep in mind to help guide your communications with stakeholders and partners:   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Who is your audience? When communicating with stakeholders and project partners, it’s important to consider who you’re working with. Consider all of the people who need to understand the BI tools and processes you build when communicating. The sales or marketing team has different goals and expertise than the data science team, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What do they already know? Because different users have different levels of knowledge and expertise, it can be useful to consider what they already know before communicating with them. This provides a baseline for your communications and prevents you from overexplaining yourself or skipping over any information they need to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What do they need to know? Different stakeholders need different kinds of information. For instance, a user might want to understand how to access and use the data or any dashboards you create, but they probably aren’t as interested in the nitty-gritty details about how the data was cleaned. \n",
    "\n",
    "* How can you best communicate what they need to know? After you have considered your audience, what they already know, and what they need to know, you need to choose the best way to communicate that information to them. This might be an email report, a small meeting, or a cross-team presentation with a Q&A section.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create realistic deadlines. Before you start a project, make a list of dependencies and potential roadblocks so you can assess how much extra time to give yourself when you discuss project expectations and timelines with your stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Know your project. When you have a good understanding about why you are building a new BI tool, it can help you connect your work with larger initiatives and add meaning to the project. Keep track of your discussions about the project over email or meeting notes, and be ready to answer questions about how certain aspects are important for your organization. In short, it should be easy to understand and explain the value the project is bringing to the company. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Communicate often. Your stakeholders will want regular updates. Keep track of key project milestones, setbacks, and changes. Another great resource to use is a changelog, which can provide a chronologically ordered list of modifications. Then, use your notes to create a report in a document that you share with your stakeholders. \n",

In other words, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone.\n",

    "* Data integrity: It involves the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its entire life cycle. Typical issues related to data integrity include duplicates, missing information, inconsistent structure, or not conforming to business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second data availability challenge has to do with visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data visibility: It is a degree or extent to which information can be identified, monitored, and integrated from disparate internal and external sources. For instance, employees working in a company's operations department might have no idea what data is stored in the communications department. Or someone working in the logistics unit might have data files that contain lots of great information, but no one else even knows they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third data availability factor to be aware of is update frequency (How often disparate data sources are being refreshed with new information.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've come to a fourth data availability challenge, change (The process of altering data, either through internal processes or external influence.)\n"

    "## Data Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "AS a BI professional, you have a responsibility to treat data ethically. Data ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used. Throughout your career you will work with a lot of data. This sometimes includes PII, or personally identifiable information, which can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Privacy matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Data privacy means preserving a data subject’s information and activity any time a data transaction occurs. This is also called information privacy or data protection. Data privacy is concerned with the access, use, and collection of personal data. For the people whose data is being collected, this means they have the right to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Protection from unauthorized access to their private data\n",
    "\n",
    "* Freedom from inappropriate use of their data\n",

    "\n",
    "* Legal right to access the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protecting privacy with data anonymization \n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations use a lot of different measures to protect the privacy of their data subjects, like incorporating access permissions to ensure that only the people who are supposed to access that information can do so. Another key strategy to maintaining privacy is data anonymization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data anonymization is the process of protecting people's private or sensitive data by eliminating PII. Typically, data anonymization involves blanking, hashing, or masking personal information, often by using fixed-length codes to represent data columns, or hiding data with altered values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data might include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Telephone numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Names\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Confirmation bias: It is the tendency of people to favor information that confirms or strengthens their beliefs or values and is difficult to dislodge once affirmed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Selection bias: Selection biases occur when looking at samples that are not representative of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Historical Bias: Historical data bias occurs when socio-cultural prejudices and beliefs are mirrored into systematic processes. This becomes particularly challenging when data from historically-biased sources are used to train machine learning models—for example, if manual systems give certain groups of people poor credit ratings, and you’re using that data to train the automatic system, the automatic system will replicate and may amplify the original system’s biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Survivorship Bias: It’s easier to focus on the winners rather than the runners-up. If you think back to your favorite competition from the 2016 Olympics, it’s probably pretty tough to recall who got the silver and bronze. Survivorship bias influences us to focus on the characteristic of winners, due to a lack of visibility of other samples—confusing our ability to discern correlation and causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Availability Bias: Availability of data has a big influence on how we view the world—but not all data is investigated and weighed equally. It’s likely that your perception shifted based on the immediately available information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Outlier Bias: Some data is convenient to visualize as an average, but this simple operation hides the effect of outliers and anomalies, and skews our observations."

    "## Meaningful metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanity metrics are data points that are intended to impress others but are not indicative of actual performance and therefore cannot reveal any meaningful business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five key points BI professionals take into account when choosing metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of metrics: More information is not always better. BI professionals limit the number of metrics on dashboards to focus specifically on the ones that are key to a project’s success. Key metrics are relevant and actionable\n",
    "\n",
    "* Alignment with business objectives: Understanding the business objectives can help you narrow down which metrics will support those goals and measure their success.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The necessary technologies and processes: It’s important to confirm that the necessary technologies and processes are in place for the metrics you’re choosing. If you can’t obtain and analyze the necessary data, then those metrics aren’t going to be very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The cadence of data: You have to consider how frequently the data becomes available. If a lot of metrics are delivered at a different cadence and frequency, it becomes difficult to schedule a review.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use SMART methodology: The SMART methodology is a useful tool for creating effective questions to ask stakeholders. It can also be used to identify and refine key metrics by ensuring that they are specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound. This can help you avoid vague or super-high-level metrics that aren’t useful to stakeholders, and instead create metrics that are precise and informative.\n"

    "## North star metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "BI professionals also use another specific kind of metric to measure the long-term success of the entire business or team; this metric is often referred to as a north star metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "A company’s north star metric goes beyond short-term goals– it’s intended to capture the core measurable value of a business’s product or services over its entire lifetime. These metrics are a guiding light that drive a business forward. That’s why it’s called a north star metric–like the north star can be used to navigate the wilderness, these metrics can be used to navigate business decisions and lead a business to growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this metric as the guiding light for the entire business is useful in three primary ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cross-team alignment: Different teams have different specialties and focuses that help a business function. They aren’t always working on the same projects or with the same metrics, which can make it difficult to align across the entire business. A north star metric allows all of the teams to have a consistent goal to focus on, even as they work on different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tracking growth: It can be difficult to understand and track the growth of an entire organization over time without understanding the driving metrics that determine growth. A north star metric provides a long-term measurable data point that stakeholders can focus on when discussing overall performance and growth in a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focusing values: A north star metric is primarily a guiding principle for a business– it determines what is important to the organization and stakeholders. This means that choosing the right metric to guide a business can help keep the values in check– whether that’s customer satisfaction, number of customers completing the sales cycle, or customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a north star metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Because north star metrics are so key to a business’s ongoing success, choosing the right metric is a foundational part of a business intelligence strategy. The north star metric has to measure the most essential part or mission of the business. And because every business is different, every business’s north star metric is going to be unique. In order to determine what the most useful north star metric might be, there are a few questions you can ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is essential to this business’s processes?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the most important KPIs being measured?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Out of those KPIs, what captures all of the necessary information about this business?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can the other metrics be structured around that primary metric?"

    "## Bridge the gap from current state to ideal state\n",
    "\n",
    "Business intelligence professionals continually monitor processes and systems to determine if it’s necessary to make updates for greater efficiency and optimization. These professionals explore ways to bring the current state closer to the ideal state. They do this through a process called gap analysis, which is a method for examining and evaluating the current state of a process in order to identify opportunities for improvement in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gap analysis involves understanding where you currently are compared to where you want to be so that you can bridge the gap. BI uses gap analysis to do all kinds of things, such as improve data delivery systems or create dashboard reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context and data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying stakeholder needs, it’s also important for the BI professional to understand the context of the data they interact with and present. As you know, context is the condition in which something exists or happens; it turns raw data into meaningful information by providing the data perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also critical that BI professionals ensure the quality and integrity of the data stakeholders are accessing. If the data is incorrect, the reporting tools won’t be accurate, and stakeholders won’t be able to make appropriate decisions — no matter how much context they have been given.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building structures and systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of a BI professional’s job is building structures and systems. This means designing database storage systems, organizing the data, and working with database governance specialists to maintain those systems. It also involves creating pipeline tools that move and transform data automatically throughout the system to get data where it needs to go to be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "These structures and systems can keep data organized, accessible, and useful for stakeholders during their decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sharing findings\n",
    "\n",
    "A BI professional creates automated systems to deliver findings to stakeholders or dashboards that monitor incoming data and provide current updates that users can navigate on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acting on insights\n",
    "\n",
    "BI focuses on automating processes and information channels in order to transform relevant data into actionable insights that are easily available to decision-makers. These insights guide business decisions and development. But the BI process doesn’t stop there: BI professionals continue to measure those results, monitor data, and make adjustments to the system in order to account for changes or new requests from stakeholders."
